# Pantry

Pantry is an application designed to store an inventory of your pantry/fridge and a store of recipes.
The goal is to be able to designate which recipes you would like to cook and have it dynamically create a grocery shopping list for you. Should support adding recipes to your 'binder', units of measurement for ingredients and telling when you would need more of something than you have in stock. etc.

more requirements/features to come during planning
